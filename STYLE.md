# Style guide

## JS
* Use camelCase for variable names
* column limit: 80
* At least one comment per function
* use const and let instead of var
* The use of a variable should be obvious due the it's name or a comment
* the structure of the html, the code and the style should be in separate files
* Indent continuation lines at least +4 spaces

## D3
* Create no more than one new element with each block
* Put each new method on its own indented line.
* Assign each new element a class name identical to the block name
* if a new selection is made, methods on it should have a 6 space indent instead of 4
