# Day 1
Decided to update proposal with a third unique graph. Instead of 4 linked interactive graphs of 2 types I will now have 3 different linked interactive graphs.  

# Day 2
Found out geojsons are easier to use than shapefiles and found a script that converts shapefiles to geojson.  
Made a dropdown for time and a button to switch it between years and time periods

# Day 3
Temporarily using a picture of the Netherlands as placeholder to click on.
I will probably have the map on the left of the screen, pie chart upper-right and line chart lower-right. with the buttons above the map.
