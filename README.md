# Quality of Life in the Netherlands
Koen Dielhoff

## Introduction
The [leefbaarometer](https://data.overheid.nl/data/dataset/leefbaarometer-2-0---meting-2016) has data about how well people are living, i.e the quality of life (QoL), in certain areas of the Netherlands. The score ranges from 1, very insufficient, to 9, excellent. The development of the QoL has also been given a score, which ranges from 1, large regression, to 7, large progression.  
With this data I made this map so people can easily search and find how good the quality of life is in their and any of their acquaintances' neighbourhoods.
